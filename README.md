# GitHub-review

The server provides listing of all public repositories on the GitHub platform associated with a specific user. After downloading the repository contents to the local device and running the server, it handles GET requests in the following format: localhost:8080/github/repos?username=${username}. Only repositories that are not forks and belong to the user whose name is provided as a parameter in the request are returned. The response includes the name of each of these repositories, the GitHub account name of the repository owner, the names of all branches created in each of the listed repositories, as well as the hash of the latest commit made in each branch. In case of providing a non-existent username in the request, information about a non-existent user will be returned. The server only handles requests containing an 'Accept' header with the value: 'application/json'. If the 'Accept' header in the sent request has a value of 'application/xml', an appropriate message will be returned. In case of other irregularities, the server will return the appropriate information.
